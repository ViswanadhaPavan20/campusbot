# Campus Bot - Chatbot for SRGEC (Seshadri Rao Gudlavalleru Engineering College)

Campus Bot is an AI-powered chatbot designed to assist students, faculty, and visitors with their queries regarding SRGEC (Seshadri Rao Gudlavalleru Engineering College, Gudlavalleru). It utilizes the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) architecture, combining information retrieval from a web-scraped knowledge base with natural language generation capabilities.

## Features

- `Natural Language Understanding`: Campus Bot can understand and respond to user queries in natural language, making the interaction intuitive and user-friendly.
- `Web-Scraped Knowledge Base`: The chatbot leverages a knowledge base created by web scraping relevant information from the SRGEC website using Beautiful Soup4.
- `Vector Database`: The scraped information is stored in a Qdrant vector database, allowing efficient retrieval of relevant information using semantic similarity.
- `Retrieval-Augmented Generation`: Campus Bot employs the RAG architecture, combining information retrieval from the knowledge base with natural language generation to provide informative and contextual responses.
- `Streamlit Interface`: The chatbot features a user-friendly interface built with the Streamlit framework, making it accessible and easy to use.
- `Cloud Deployment`: Campus Bot is deployed on Streamlit Cloud, ensuring seamless access and scalability.
